# Symmetric Encryption Demonstration 

- accept input from a the console or GUI, 
- encrypt the user provided data, 
- save the encrypted results to a file, 
- print the encryption results, 
- decrypt the file, 
- print the decryption results to the console

  Uses AES encryption. 
 - AES encryption is a symmetric block cipher.
 - AES uses the same key (or cipher) to encrypt and decrypt data.
